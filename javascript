#JAVASCRIPT
Javascript is a scripted language that is used to create interactive and dynamic websites.
Interactive websites means that,user can perform some actions on websites for exampe: button click, submit a form,write comments and live chat.
Dynamic websites means that, the website that changes its contect or layout like sliding effect,Ecommerce website and Quiz website
#FUNCTIONS
 A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions allow developers to write code once and use it multiple times, which enhances code efficiency and readability.
1.Function declaration.
2.Parameter and arguments.
3.Return value.
4. Calling function.
#SCOPE
Scope determines the accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of the code. Understanding scope is vital for avoiding errors related to variable accessibility and for writing cleaner, more maintainable code.
1.Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
2.Local Scope: Variables declared within a function or block are local to that function or block and cannot be accessed from outside it.
3.Function Scope: Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function.
4.Block Scope: Variables declared with let or const within a block are accessible only within that block.
#VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES
A variable in JavaScript is a container that holds data values. Variables allow you to store, update, and manipulate information throughout your code.
1.var: Has function scope and can be redeclared.
2.let: Has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
3.const: Also has block scope, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for values that should not change.
#DATA TYPE
Data types in JavaScript define the type of data that a variable can hold. Understanding these types is key to performing correct operations on variables and avoiding errors.
1.Numbers: Used for numeric values (e.g., integers and floating-point numbers).
2.Strings: A sequence of characters used to represent text.
3.Booleans: Represents true or false, typically used in conditions and logical operations.
4.Arrays: A list of values, which can be of any data type, stored in a single variable.
5.Objects: Complex data structures that can hold multiple values and functions (methods) as properties.
#OPERATORS
Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values (operands). They are the building blocks of expressions in JavaScript.
1.Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations.
Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), and ** (exponentiation).
2.Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.
Examples: = (assign), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply and assign), /= (divide and assign).
3.Comparison Operators: Used to compare values and return a boolean (true or false).
Examples: == (equal), != (not equal), === (strict equal), !== (strict not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to).
4.Logical Operators: Used to combine multiple conditions.
Examples: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT).
5.Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand.
Examples: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), typeof (type of operand).
6.Ternary Operator: A shorthand for an if-else statement.
Example: condition ? expression1 : expression2.
